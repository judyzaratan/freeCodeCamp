        <p>Alan Turing was a British cryptanalyst that played a major part in deciphering the Nazi Engima machine, a tool utilized by German forces in encoding messages during World War II. Sadly, later in his life, he was convicted for being a homosexual.
          As a sentence for his conviction, he chose to be chemically castrated instead of prison. Turing died a couple of years after from cyanide poisoning. In 2013, he was posthumously pardoned by Queen Elizabeth II. </p>
